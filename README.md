# Webhooks Subscriber

This is really just a developer/tester tool to verify webhook notifications.

### Usage
A Subscriber can be created with a unique URL generated by the app. Use the Subscriber URL
to set up a Webhook subscription. The app will then display requests as they are made through WebSockets.

### Developer setup
- ruby ~= 3.1
- postgres
- bundler

```bash
bin/setup
rails s
```
